# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Building Images Interactively

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will create our first container image.

It will be a basic distribution image, but we will pre-install
the package `figlet`.

We will: 

* Create a container from a base image.
* Install software manually in the container, and turn it
  into a new image.
* Learn about new commands: `docker commit`, `docker tag`, and `docker diff`.
