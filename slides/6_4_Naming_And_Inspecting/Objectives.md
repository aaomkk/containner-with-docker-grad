# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Naming and inspecting containers

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about an important
Docker concept: container *naming*.

Naming allows us to:

* Reference easily a container.
* Ensure unicity of a specific container.

We will also see the `inspect` command, which gives a lot of details about a container.
